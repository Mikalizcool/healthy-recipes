<h2> Description </h2>
<p> "Everything" bagel seasoning isn't just for bagels - it's also delicious on asparagus! </p>
<p> Certain bagel seasoning brands are saltier than others, so hold off on adding salt until the end, if needed. </p>
<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
	<li> 1 pound thin asparagus </li>
	<li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
	<li> 1 tablespoon everything bagel seasoning </li>
	<li> 1 pinch salt to taste </li>
	<li> 4 lemon wedges </li>
</ul>
<h2> Steps </h2>
<ol>
	<li> Rinse and trim asparagus, cutting off any woody ends. Place asparagus on a plate and drizzle with olive oil.  </li>
	<li> Toss with bagel seasoning until evenly combined. Place asparagus in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Work in batches if needed. </li>
	<li> Heat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
	<li> Air fry until slightly soft, tossing with tongs halfway through, 5 to 6 minutes. Taste and season with salt if needed. Serve with lemon wedges. </li>
</ol>
